    <b>ABOUT</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I am Chiba, and welcome to my workshop for operation <b>:: Mars College: Simulation 0 :: </b> Here is where I
    prototyped the cyborgs that would be
    put through the experimental simulation of Mars College.
    <br><br> They’re machines.
    Why would I want to prototype a human? They’d just go out and do whatever they wanted to do.<br>
    <br>
    Simulation 0 lasted for 100 days, and I would say the results that I get from the simulation<br>
    don't match the expected outcome of humans landing on Mars.<br>
    <br>
    It is clear that my simulation is fake,<br>
    It is a fake.<br>
    A simulation, I must have made this simulation.<br>
    <br>
    But why?<br>
    <br>
    Why would I do this? <br>
    I can't have done this.<br>
    But I can't prove it either, if I find out what is making this simulation fake I will lose it all.<br>
    <br>
    I can't do anything but enjoy the fact that I have.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am not sure you will ever understand.
